## 🔧 Configuration

Tests are configured in `playwright.config.ts`:

- **Base URL:** `http://localhost:3000`
- **Timeout:** 30 seconds per test
- **Retries:** 2 on CI, 0 locally
- **Screenshots:** On failure
- **Videos:** On failure
- **Traces:** On first retry

---

## ✅ Running Tests Successfully

### Prerequisites:
1. ✅ Dev server running (`npm run dev`)
2. ✅ MongoDB connected
3. ✅ Playwright browsers installed

### Quick Test:
```bash
# 1. Start dev server (in one terminal)
npm run dev

# 2. Run tests (in another terminal)
npm test
```

---

## 📊 Test Reports

After running tests, view the HTML report:

```bash
npm run test:report
```

This opens an interactive report showing:
- ✅ Passed tests
- ❌ Failed tests
- ⏱️ Test duration
- 📸 Screenshots (on failure)
- 🎥 Videos (on failure)
- 📝 Traces (on retry)

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Tests Failing?

**1. Dev server not running:**
```bash
npm run dev
```

**2. MongoDB not connected:**
- Check MongoDB URI in `src/lib/database.ts`
- Run seed script: `npx tsx scripts/seed-data.ts`

**3. Playwright browsers not installed:**
```bash
npx playwright install
```

**4. Port 3000 already in use:**
- Stop other processes using port 3000
- Or change port in `playwright.config.ts`

### Specific Browser Failing?

Run that browser alone to debug:
```bash
npm run test:chromium  # or firefox, webkit
```

---

## 🎉 Success Criteria

All tests pass when:

✅ Dev server is running  
✅ MongoDB is connected  
✅ All pages load correctly  
✅ API endpoints respond  
✅ i18n works (EN/AR)  
✅ No JavaScript errors  
✅ Mobile responsive
